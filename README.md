# 🧠 Problem Solving & Projects in C++

This repository is a personal journey to strengthen my logic and programming skills using C++, from beginner to advanced levels  
I follow the structured roadmap provided by **[Programming Advices](https://www.programmingadvices.com/)**, which focuses on mastering core programming concepts and logic.

Along with solving logic-based problems, I'm also building practical **mini-projects** to apply what I’ve learned.

## 🚀 Goals

- Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking step by step.
- Build strong programming logic and flow control.
- Solve challenges by **writing my own functions** instead of using built-in library functions.
- Apply concepts through hands-on **C++ projects**.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

/C1/ → Beginner level: basic logic, conditions, loops, and simple operations
/C2/ → Intermediate: matrices, strings, file handling, and multi-dimensional logic
/C3/ → Advanced: refactoring and optimizing code, handling date/time logic, and writing clean, efficient solutions
/Projects/ → Mini-projects applying what I've learned


### 📁 Projects Overview

- **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**  
  A simple console-based game built in C++. Focuses on:
  - Game logic using `enum` types  
  - Code organization using `struct`s and functions  
  - No design or graphics — just pure logic and console I/O  
  - Helps practice control flow and decision-making structures

- **Bank1 Project**  
  A basic file-based banking system. Supports:
  - Viewing all clients from a file  
  - Adding a new client  
  - Updating existing client data  
  - Deleting a client  

- **Bank2 Project (Extended)**  
  An enhanced version of Bank1 that adds basic **transaction operations**:
  - Deposit  
  - Withdraw  
  - Balance check  

  This version simulates a functional banking interface using file handling, user input, and structured logic.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:**  Visual Studio Community
- **Approach:** Custom implementation (logic-first, no built-in functions or STL)
